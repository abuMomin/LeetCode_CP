# Technique

- Solve previosuly solved problems
- Now solve Leetcode_ProblemSolving top 150 problems (arranged nicely in Neetcode)
- AFTER SOLVING THESE 150 problems, If you want to solve more, then explore other problems. 

---
### 1. Start from EASY, then go MEDIUM, and HARD
1. First try to solve all the easy ones of each DSA.
2. Then, Medium of each.
3. Consequently, HARD.

### 2. First think SOLUTION, then CODE
1. First think of the how to solve it logically, Do not think how to code it.
    - Didn't get what it means? [Check the video.](https://youtu.be/xF554Tlzo-c?si=tNe_hSI43OE0Q2om&t=162)
2. Code your solution. 
3. Run test-cases, submit, get it accepted. 
4. Jump to check the optimal way (Jump to Step. 3.2)
5. Think! Try to solve it in optimal way.
6. Now, CODE.

### 3. Learn by doing the in the right approach
1. First, try to come up with your solution (From Step. 2.1)
2. Now, Find the optimal DSA to solve it.
    - ChatGPT
    - or use, Google / YouTube / LeetCode
3. Learn necessary DSA
4. Learn Why it is the optimal way?
5. Do not check the solution before Brainstorming attempt to solve it optimally. (Jump back to Step. 2.3)


### 4. Stop Wasting Time for than an HOUR in 1 problem
1. Go to check for the best solution.
    - [NeetCode](https://neetcode.io/practice), or,
    - top 3 discussions on LeetCode, or,
    - ChatGPT
2. Understand, and learn the correct coding approach.
3. Learn necessary DSA (if required)
4. Replicate it considering the corner cases. 
5. Build, and RUN it.

### 5. Congrats, if you able to solve it by your own, BUT..
1. You now need to check optimal solution to solve it. (From Step. 2)
2. If you have done it optimally, Double CONGRATULATIONS !!! ðŸ”¥

### 6. Finally
1. When you are done with the problem, learn more about the DSA.
    - Maintain the STREAKs on leetcode in someway. ðŸ˜›
    - Spend some days on DSA if necessary.
2. Try to code the DSA from Scratch.

## Types of Big O Notations
There are seven common types of big O notations. These include:

1. O(1): Constant complexity. 
2. O(logn): Logarithmic complexity. 
3. O(n): Linear complexity. 
4. O(nlogn): Loglinear complexity. 
5. O(n^x): Polynomial complexity. 
6. O(X^n): Exponential time. 
7. O(n!): Factorial complexity.
